// 950. Reveal Cards In Increasing Order
// Input: deck = [17,13,11,2,3,5,7]
// Output: [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
// Explanation: 
// We get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this order does not matter), and reorder it.
// After reordering, the deck starts as [2,13,3,11,5,17,7], where 2 is the top of the deck.
// We reveal 2, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].
// We reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom.  The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].
// We reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [7,13,11,17].
// We reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [11,17,13].
// We reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [13,17].
// We reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [17].
// We reveal 17.
// Since all the cards revealed are in increasing order, the answer is correct.


//aproach:
/* we need to return vector in such a order that at ending the order of revealed card is in ascending order 
that when we see the top card ,remove it and place the 2nd card at the bottom of queue 
to solve we'll think backwards i.e.  (i) sort the vector, (ii)Move last card to the front and (iii)place the new card at the front 

So firstly, Loop through sorted deck from largest to smallest:
If deque is not empty:
Move the last card to front (reverse of putting 2nd card to bottom)
Then insert the current card at front (undo revealing)
