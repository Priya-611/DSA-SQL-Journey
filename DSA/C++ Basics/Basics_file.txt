C++ Basics: 

Day 1: C++ Basics & Control Flow
- Core Syntax: iostream, namespaces, main function.
- Variables & Operators: Declaration, arithmetic, increment/decrement.
- Typecasting: Explicit type conversion.
- Control Flow: if-else, switch statements, ternary operator.
- Loops: for, while, do-while, and for-each loops with practical examples.


Day 2: Operators, Functions & Arrays
- Bitwise Operators: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, Left/Right Shift.
- Built-in Functions: Utilized cmath for common mathematical operations.
- Functions: Deep dive into pass by value vs. pass by reference.
- Recursion: Implemented factorial and Fibonacci series.
- Arrays: Manipulating 1D and 2D arrays, including finding min/max and calculating sums.


Day 3: Searching, Sorting & Vectors
- Searching Algorithms: Implemented Linear Search and Binary Search.
- Sorting Algorithms: Practiced Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
- std::vector: Explored dynamic arrays, push_back, size, capacity, insert, erase, and 2D vectors.
- Duplicate Removal: Implemented custom logic for removing duplicates from sorted vectors.


Day 4: Strings
- std::string: Comprehensive use of string manipulation functions like getline, append, length, substr, find, replace, insert, erase, and compare.
- String Operations: Implemented string reversal, palindrome checks, vowel/consonant counting, duplicate character removal, and anagram detection.


Day 5: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals
- Classes & Objects: Defined blueprints and instances, understanding memory allocation.
- Object Instantiation: Handled objects on both the stack and heap (new/delete).
- Constructors: Implemented default, parameterized, and copy constructors.
- Inheritance: Explored Single-Level, Multi-Level, Multiple, and Hierarchical Inheritance.
- Ambiguity Resolution: Used the scope resolution operator (::) to resolve ambiguities in multiple inheritance.


Day 6: Advanced OOP & Polymorphism
- Memory Initializer List: Used for efficient member initialization in constructors.
- Polymorphism (Compile-time):
     Method Overloading: Functions with the same name but different parameters.
     Operator Overloading: Redefined operators for custom types (e.g., + for Complex numbers).
- Polymorphism (Run-time):
- Virtual Functions: Achieved dynamic binding using virtual keyword and override.
- Function Overriding: Derived classes providing specific implementations for base class functions.
- Abstraction: Understood abstract classes and pure virtual functions.
- Encapsulation: Practiced data hiding using access specifiers (private, public, protected).
- Friend Functions & Classes: Allowed non-members access to private data.
- Static Members: Understood class-level members shared by all objects.
- enum: Created named constants.
- Inline Functions: Optimized short functions for compiler inlining.


Day 7: Number Conversions & Patterns
- Memory Allocation: Reviewed Static vs. Dynamic allocation (Stack vs. Heap, new/delete).
- Abstract vs. Concrete Classes: Differentiated their roles and instantiation.
- Ambiguity Resolution (Revisited): Further examples of using :: for inherited members.
- Number Conversions: Implemented logic for:
     Decimal to Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal.
     Binary to Decimal.
     Utilized built-in manipulators (oct, hex) and std::stoi for conversions.
- Pattern Printing: Generated various patterns using nested loops, including:
     Basic star and number triangles.
     Reverse patterns.
     Pyramid patterns.
     Floyd's Triangle.
     Alphabet patterns (sequential, row-wise, and reverse).
