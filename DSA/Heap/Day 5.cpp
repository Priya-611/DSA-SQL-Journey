/*using min Heap to keep minimum frequency element on top (so that when popped minimum frequency gets deleted) 
By default, priority_queue in C++ is a max‚Äëheap (it puts largest on top). but here we want min-heap with special rules:
If frequencies are different ‚Üí smaller frequency should be on top (so it gets removed first when size > k).
If frequencies are same ‚Üí lexicographically larger word should be on top (because we want smaller word to stay).
To teach priority_queue this rule, we write a struct Compare with a special function operator().

üëâ By creating struct Compare, we teach the heap how to order elements.
üëâ This struct is passed as the third template parameter of priority_queue.

operator() means: when you ‚Äúcall‚Äù a Compare object like a function, run this code.
We don‚Äôt call it manually.
üëâ The priority_queue calls this operator internally whenever it needs to compare two elements.

Internally, priority_queue does this automatically.
Compare cmp;
cmp(a,b);  // calls operator()


Condition logic inside:

If frequencies are equal (a.first == b.first):
return a.second < b.second;
üëâ If a.second (the word) is alphabetically smaller, we return true (means a is ‚Äúgreater‚Äù in min‚Äëheap sense, so b should come first).

Otherwise: return a.first > b.first;
üëâ The pair with higher frequency should come before, so we return true if a‚Äôs frequency is larger.
