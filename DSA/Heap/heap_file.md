## Heap Learning Outcome: 

### **Day 1 – Heap Basics & Building Heaps**

* Learned what a heap is (complete binary tree with heap property).
* Understood array representation of a heap (parent, left, right index formula).
* Studied min‑heap vs max‑heap and their usage.
* Implemented **max‑heap** and **min‑heap** using C++ STL `priority_queue`.
* Learned two ways to build a heap:

  * **Insertion method** (repeated insert).
  * **Bottom‑up heapify method**.
* Implemented custom heap insertion for both max and min heaps.
* Practiced building heaps manually and printing elements.

### **Day 2 – Insertions & Deletions**

* Wrote code to **insert new elements** into an existing heap (max/min).
* Implemented **deletion of arbitrary elements** from a heap.
* Implemented **deletion of root element** from a heap.
* Practiced modifying heap to have **second largest at root**.
* Built heap with **prime number check** (insert only primes).

---

### **Day 3 – Heap Sort & Heap Property Check**

* Implemented **Heap Sort** using max heap.
* Learned about time complexity `O(n log n)` and in‑place sorting.
* Wrote code to **check if a given binary tree follows heap property**:

  * Count nodes,
  * Check completeness,
  * Verify heap property.
* Implemented **increase‑key** and **decrease‑key** operations on a heap.
* Practiced finding **Kth largest element** in an array using min‑heap.

### **Day 4 – Kth Problems & Heap Variants**

* Solved **Kth Largest Element in a Stream** (LeetCode 703) using min‑heap.
* Solved **Kth Largest Element in an Array** (LeetCode 215) using min‑heap.
* Solved **Last Stone Weight** (LeetCode 1046) using max‑heap.
* Solved **Top K Frequent Elements** (LeetCode 347) using min‑heap with frequency map.

---

### **Day 5 – Frequency & Word Problems**

* Solved **Sort Characters by Frequency** (LeetCode 451) using max‑heap.
* Solved **Top K Frequent Words** (LeetCode 692) with custom comparator.
* Solved **K Closest Points to Origin** (LeetCode 973) using max‑heap.

---

### **Day 6 – Matrix & Number Problems**

* Solved **K Weakest Rows in a Matrix** (LeetCode 1337) using max‑heap.
* Solved **Find Kth Largest Integer in Array** (LeetCode 1985) with custom comparator for strings.
* Solved **Find K Closest Elements** (LeetCode 658) using max‑heap.
* Solved **Ugly Number II** (LeetCode 264) using min‑heap & set for duplicates.
* Implemented **K Smallest Pairs** (LeetCode 373) with nested loops (TLE for large inputs).

---

### **Day 7 – More Heap Practice**

* Solved **Relative Ranks** (LeetCode 506) using max‑heap.
* Solved **Kth Smallest Element in Sorted Matrix** (LeetCode 378) using max‑heap.
* Solved **Kth Largest Sum in Binary Tree Levels** (LeetCode 2583) using min‑heap and BFS.
* Practiced fraction problem (LeetCode 786) without heap (sorting approach).
